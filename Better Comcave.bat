:: Hello Comcave. How are you?
:: This little and dirty script is nothing about you, but there is an problem :(
:: There are several days where is nothing to do!
:: But i must sit at home to make sure that i can solve your CCLauncher Captchas.
:: That´s ok but Captchas are for Bots and not for Humans :p
:: Those things steal my time, that i can 
:: "use for Playing xBox"
:: "use with my family"
:: "use with my dog or cat"
:: and if i really nothing to do, maybe i use my free time with my wife. <3
::
:: Anyway this is the simplest solution to trick your CC-Launcher.
:: Please don´t change your running system.
:: I wouldn´t like it, when i must use my free time to write another script that will simply solve your captchas.
::
:: Stay fresh an be cool!
:: Anyone including you and your technicals can learning from those things and can search for new things to prevent such actions.
